# React Project Part 1

1. Make some test data
2. Make a very simple mock-up
3. Break it into components and write the components
4. Use props to pass down data and customize components
5. Test

Your project should meet these requirements:
    - It has at least 3 React components

        A component is a function that returns JSX and components are used like they’re an HTML element

        main.tsx does not count as a component, it doesn’t have a function that returns JSX

    - It’s displaying the test data

        You can put your array of data in whatever file you want, or even in its own file

    - It’s using at least 1 prop on your own components

        A prop is set like it’s an HTML attribute, and received as a destructured parameter property

        key does not count for this, you need to come up with your own prop and practice setting it and receiving it

    - No red errors/warnings in the console in the browser

    - No type errors in VS Code

# Part 2

1. Move your test data into state
2. Implement the create ability.
3. Implement the delete ability.
4. Implement the update ability.
5. Test

At this point, your project must meets these new requirements:

    A user can create new items (the new items will all have the same data)

    A user can delete items

    A user can update at least one property on the items

    As well as the requirements from last week
